\item{p}{daily survival probability}

\item{f}{blood feeding rate}

\item{Q}{human blood index}

\item{v}{daily egg production}

\description{
Generates a single named list with parameters to construct a
'mosquito_rm' object (see inst/include/Mosquito-RM.hpp for constructor parameters).
Please note that 'N' (number of patches) may not be the same as the total number of patches
constructed in the tile object, due to the existence of reservoir patches. However the
first 1,...,N patches should be non-reservoir patches (simulated explicitly).
This model needs a log stream with name 'mosquito'.
