# Overview
These are the MASH modules that are implemented now.


# Health Modules

These represent human health states.

## Forced SI

A human is susceptible or infected. A susceptible person can recover. A person
becomes infected only if they receive an infectious bites. This module assumes
it will receive a list of infectious bites at the start of each time step.

There are no interventions possible.

# Location Modules

## Single Location

Everybody is in one location, all the time. This is a well-mixed system.

## Simple Trip

Each person lives somewhere, but they travel to another place and, after
a waiting time, travel home.

## Markov Flow

There is a transition rate from one location to another, and individuals
drift around according to those transitions rates, with no place to call home.


# Bloodmeal Modules

## Exponential Bites

There is a steady stream of bites with some biting rate.
Each location has a biting rate that is predetermined.


# Mosquito Modules

None yet.
