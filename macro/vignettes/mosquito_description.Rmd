Describes what should be in the first mosquito module.

# Introduction

We already wrote two mosquito modules as part of MASH.
Both were in C++, the PfSI and PfMOI versions. I'm about
to write a version in R that fits in with the rest of
MASH-macro. This version will follow a protocol, so it
has a well-specified set of inputs and outputs. This document
will describe what the mosquito model should have,
given what was in the previous versions.


# Ross-Macdonald-style deterministic mosquito module

## Overview
The PfSI code is in the MASH repository under
`MASH/macro.pfsi/src/Mosquito-RM.cpp.` The PfMOI code
uses the exact same file. Both are Ross-Macdonald-style
and deterministic except for emergence.

As a reminder, the PfSI code uses a data structure called
a Tile, which represents an area where all of the
simulations are synchronous. The idea was that large
parallel simulations could create multiple, neighboring
Tiles. Here, there is one Tile that has some global
information.

Each Tile has multiple Patches. Every population of
mosquitoes is considered homogeneous within a Patch,
so we expect some of the definition of the Mosquito-RM
module to involve the patch.

Time is measured in days. Assume all the math below is applied to
all patches individually, except for diffusion, where
mosquitoes move among patches.

From the header file, we get basic information about
the parameters and state space. In parentheses after each
is the size of its array.


## Parameters

Notation here comes mostly from Smith, Battle, et al 2012, in Box 2, but
it follows variables defined in the code.

EIP                 Extrinsic incubation period on each day of the year (365)
maxEIP              The count of days in the longest EIP.
p                   Daily survival, conditional survival for a day.

Y               Incubating mosquitoes (N)
Y0              Newly-infected mosquitoes (N)
Z               Infectious mosquitoes (N)

## Input variables

Variable            Description
------------------  -----------------------------------------------
kappa ($\kappa$)    Net infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes (N)


## Aquatic Dynamics

The aquatic dynamics for this model is simple.
The emergence parameter dictates, for each patch, the rate
at which adults emerge. The stochastic dynamics draws
from a Poisson distribution with that rate.
$$
\begin{aligned}
  X & \sim \mbox{Poisson}(\lambda_{d}) \\
  M & \rightarrow M + x
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $d$ is the day of the year. The random variable $X$
is Poisson-distributed, and we add a sample $x$ from $X$
to the adult mosquito population.

## Adult Dynamics

### Reading the algorithm
First, everybody survives a bit.
$$
\begin{aligned}
  M & = pM \\
  Y & = pY \\
  Z & = pZ
\end{aligned}
$$
There won't be another step where mosquitoes are removed from
these categories. They die off geometrically.
Then we get newly-infected mosquitoes.
$$
 Y_{0} = \max(a\kappa(M-Y), 0)
$$
This is for each patch. And each newly-infected mosquito is
also considered incubating, so
$$
  Y\rightarrow Y + Y_{0}
$$
Some mosquitoes graduate from incubation to infectious.
These are the mosquitoes that were newly-infected EIP
days ago. The trick is that the EIP can be different on
different days, so you have to add them for all days where
the EIP ends today.
$$
Z_p \rightarrow Z_p + \sum_{e=d-\infty}^d p^{d-e}(Y_0\psi^{d-e})_p\delta(d - e - \mbox{EIP}_e)
$$
The code does this calculation simply with some nice matrix work.
The $p^{d-e}$ is a constant survival rate per day of EIP.
The $\psi$ diffuses the initial $Y_0$, as we will do to
the rest of the variables, but it does that once per day
of the EIP. (The MASH-PfSI code applies $\psi$ once, but it
should be applied each day.) The subscript ${}_p$ means we are
picking out the newly-infectious mosquitoes that
diffused to this patch on that day.

Where past values are missing for incubating mosquitoes, in
the equation above, we initialize them with $Z(1-p)$.

All of the mosquitoes diffuse a bit around their patches.
$$
\begin{aligned}
  M & = M \psi \\
  Y & = Y \psi \\
  Z & = Z \psi
\end{aligned}
$$

### Analyzing the algorithm

It can help to understand a time step if we try to combine all
of the steps into one equation, where the right-hand
side is in terms of previous values of the adult dynamics and the
primed left-hand side is the next time step.
$$
\begin{aligned}
  M' & = p(M + \mbox{Poisson}(\lambda))\psi \\
  Y' & = (pY + \max(a\kappa p(M-Y)),0)\psi \\
  Y'_0 & = \max(a\kappa p(M-Y), 0)\psi \\
  Z' & = (pZ + \sum_{e=d-\infty}^d p^{d-e}(Y_0\psi^{d-e})_p\delta(d - e - \mbox{EIP}_e))\psi
\end{aligned}
$$

When I look for what could go wrong, when writing this as code,
I see that I might need to check that incubating mosquitoes get
the right survival applied. I could easily create an off-by-one
error there in the exponent on survival.

How would I test this code? First, identify the parameters.
$a\kappa$ apears together, as do $p\psi$, so there is no point
in testing those separately. The other parameter
is EIP. Initialization includes not only an initial $(M, Y, Y_0, Z$
but also the past $Y_0$.

One test of the delay in the system would set the emergence
rate to a constant value and then change it on a day, in
order to see $Z$ change EIP days later. Another test would
be a similar change in EIP at a particular day of the year,
to see it affect $Z$.

## Infection Dynamics

### In the MASH-PfSI code
First, let's read the MASH-PfSI code. It uses $\kappa$ and EIR.
The MASH-macro code will be a little different because it uses
a message protocol.

We use $\beta = a Z$ for the biting rate. That means
the EIR is calculated from $\beta$, the biting weight $\omega_p$
for a patch, and the biting weight for a particular human, $\omega_h$.
$$
  \mbox{EIR} = \max(0, \beta \omega_p / \omega_h)
$$
The mosquitoes get infected at a rate determined by the
biting weight of all infectious humans.
$$
  \kappa = \sum_h c_h\omega_h
$$
Here, $c$ is the human-to-mosquito transmission efficiency.


### In the MASH-macro code

The MASH-macro code will send a list of bites to the bloodmeal.
(I write this as an assertion, but I'm asking whether we
should send $\beta$ and receive $\kappa$.)
The mosquitoes generate $aZ$ infectious bites per day for each patch.
The bloodmeal then assigns these to humans.

When the bloodmeal sends infectious bites to the mosquitoes,
we take the total count of bites per day (of infectious humans)
and sum the $c_h\omega_h$ for all of those to get $\kappa$ for
the day.
