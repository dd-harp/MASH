# Scenarios

These scenarios are requirements on the software.

## What we can simulate

 1. [The Mating Queue in Mosquito-BITES Changes Step Size.](./matingqueue.md)

 2. [Parasites have specific strains.](./parasitestrains.md)

 3. [Simulate individual mosquitoes.](./individualmosquito.md)

 4. [Mix modules with different time steps.](mixtimesteps.md)

 5. Implement a Pharmacokinetics / Pharmacodynamics (PKPD) model.


## Usability

 1. Computer scientists run a pure C++ simulation.

 2. Daniel writes a new movement model in R with existing
    modules for humans and mosquitoes.
