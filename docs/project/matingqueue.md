# The Mating Queue in Mosquito-BITES

This scenario describes what would happen if we were
to track mating in Mosquito-BITES within the MASH framework.

Emerging female mosquitoes can be born, feed, and
lay eggs all within a single day. This means that any
model for birth, biting, or laying eggs must either
be in the same module, or the modules have to have a short
time step.
