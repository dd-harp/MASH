# Simulating Individual Mosquitoes


When we simulate individuals, there are a lot of individuals.
There are about 50 infectious bites per human.
There are about 50 immature mosquitoes per adult.
That leads to 1000 mosquitoes per human, or, if you
count immature ones, 50,000 mosquitoes per human.
Therefore, we don't want to do this at a continental
scale with 800,000,000 humans.
