# Project Goals

 1. Simulate malaria for a specific region using credible models
    for people, mosquitoes, movement, and interventions on a landscape.

 2. Understand the importance of specific features in models
    by comparing how different models predict interventions for a country.

The second goal supports the first, and the second goal
depends on our ability to replace one module in the simulation
with a different module, so that we can compare them.
